I am a Ph. D. student at the Department of Statistics, Uppsala University. My current focus is Bayesian time series econometrics in general and mixed-frequency models in particular.

In August, I will start work as an Economist at the National Institute of Economic Research and the Macroeconomic Research and Simulations Division.
